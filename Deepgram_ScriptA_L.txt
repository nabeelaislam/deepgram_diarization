Script a, take one,
music
version.
I've had these headaches every afternoon.
And my nurse thinks it might just
be dehydration.
Do you drink much water during the day? Honestly,
barely. I forgot.
Coffee in the morning, then maybe a soda with lunch.
That's about it.
I also haven't drank much water today. I think I drank
like, two glasses yesterday. You should drink more.
Did you go to bingo yesterday? Yes.
I won.
