I've had these headaches every afternoon, and my nurse thinks it might just
be dehydration. Do you drink much water during the day?
Honestly
barely. I forgot. Coffee in the morning that maybe is
soda
for with lunch.
That's about it.
I also haven't drank much water today.
I think I drank, like, two glasses
yesterday.
You should drink more.
You go to bingo yesterday?
Yes.
I won.
