[0:00:03.680 - 0:00:07.120] Peter: Not great, honestly. I've had a terrible headache since this morning.
[0:00:08.280 - 0:00:10.360] Nabeela: Oh, no. Did you take anything for it?
[0:00:10.960 - 0:00:14.240] Peter: Yeah. I took four hundred milligrams of Advil around ten AM.
[0:00:14.440 - 0:00:15.160] Peter: It helped a little.
[0:00:15.610 - 0:00:16.090] Unknown: Did you
[0:00:16.150 - 0:00:17.910] Nabeela: eat anything before taking it?
[0:00:18.340 - 0:00:20.420] Peter: Just some toast and coffee. Nothing heavy.
[0:00:20.850 - 0:00:24.770] Nabeela: That might explain why it's not helping as much. You probably need more food in your system.
[0:00:25.250 - 0:00:26.610] Peter: Yeah. You're probably right.
[0:00:26.950 - 0:00:29.030] Peter: I also haven't been drinking enough water today.
[0:00:29.630 - 0:00:32.510] Nabeela: Dehydration could definitely make the headache worse.
[0:00:32.980 - 0:00:34.260] Nabeela: Try to get some rest too.
[0:00:34.750 - 0:00:36.430] Peter: Will do. Thanks, Nabilah.
