Speaker Unknown: Hey, Peter. How are you feeling today?
Speaker Unknown: Not great, honestly. I've had a terrible headache since this morning.
Speaker Unknown: Oh, no. Did you take anything for it?
Speaker Unknown: Yeah. I took four hundred milligrams of Advil around ten AM.
Speaker Unknown: It helped a little.
Speaker Unknown: Did you
Speaker Unknown: eat anything before taking it?
Speaker Unknown: Just some toast and coffee. Nothing heavy.
Speaker Unknown: That might explain why it's not helping as much. You probably need more food in your system.
Speaker Unknown: Yeah. You're probably right.
Speaker Unknown: I also haven't been drinking enough water today.
Speaker Unknown: Dehydration could definitely make the headache worse.
Speaker Unknown: Try to get some rest too.
Speaker Unknown: Will do. Thanks, Nabilah.
